TODO for Flightgear JA-37
=========================


Features and improvements:
--------------------------
GUI: Option to turn off verbose popups.
GUI: Improve Checklists.
GUI: Option to switch off hitting stuff above ground. (switched off now, might confuse users)
Aero: Make cannon pod detachable and have pointweight. (and model it above drop-tank)
Aero: Air-brakes, even though they got welded shut in mid 80ties. (Request from JazzTp)
Aero: Make wave drag again influence stores.
Control: Pitch damper should also take lateral normal (Nz) acceleration as input as per manual.
Control: Disable failure system from freezing surfaces (remove failure mode bug in 3.2- prevents)
Model: Make minimal polygon model for multiplayer LOD.
Model: Make liveries that is not 59, able to not have to use base texture.
Model: Ext. power truck more mil style textures.
Model: Put in more working instruments and controls.
Model: Make gunpod, between the fuselage and droptank.
Model: Put in not-working instruments and controls for immersion.
Model: Some control textures should be aligned so they can be better viewed from current pilot point of view.
Model: The minimum AoA the indicator should show is -4 degrees, not -7.
Model: Fix that landing gear oleo struts now are too bright.
Model: Fix the bloody irritating lag when getting near another JA37 in MP! (test if MP sounds are culprit)
Model: Radar range control should be only 3 digits. (and be another place in the cockpit if should be accurate)
Model: Make the tooltips fail when gauge fail.
Model: The reserve generator. (ram air turbine)
Model: Proper floor in the cockpit.
Model: Buttons for ejecting drop-tank/armaments. They have a flip lid.
Model: Big red indicator on radar box (top left) for ground warning.
Animation: Show wheels spinning in MP also.
Animation: Proper animation of gear doors.
Animation: Maybe the canopy should open more, the pilot is not supposed to crawl out.
Animation: Buffeting of view, when get hit, crash.
Sim: Improve autopilot further. (alt-hold should use pitch not v-speed)
Sim: Make autopilot depend fully on instrument properties not true properties. (95% done)
Sim: Implement ejection seat. (with parachute?)
Sim: Make braking parachute? (manual does not seem to indicate that the plane had one)
Sim: Reset controls after A/P let go of them.
Sim: Stop using integers in xml where floating point is expected? (is silly, not needed, rely on typecasting instead)
Sim: Make verbose property to be used in all nasal scripts. (possible include in options)
Sim: Make replay show the guided missiles flying.
Sim: Improve terrain warning system.
Sim: Replace generic setValue in nasal with specific types.
Sim: Make droptank do collision detection. (use retractable)
Sim: Make drop-tank fall down. (use slaved submodel)
Sim: Missiles should lock onto flares from other mil plane types.
Sim: Lock warning when another plane get radar lock. (ja37, m2000-5, f-14b, f-15)
Sim: Complete hydraulic dependencies: Brakes.
Sim: Hydraulic drain.
Sim: Shift-m should be a key without shift instead for convienience.
Sim: Weapons should require electrical power to track, check the manual.
Sim: Button to jettison all stores including drop-tank.
Sim: Should drop-tank require masterarm on instead of opposite, seems logical, double check manual.
Sim: Specific damage to gears in crash code, speed of impact and vertical speed separate. (terrain type?)
Sim: Make the weapon mode dial operational: simulated mode, operational mode and reduced mode.
Sim: Make data-link between Viggens.
Sim: Replace MP hit and fire messages with something else, so can leave civilian traffic in peace.
Sim: Replace nasal blinkers with JSB code.
Sim: Implement maximum speed reactions - Vne.
Sim: Implement navigation controls into the cockpit.
Sim: Engine fire: reduced thrust, stuck throttle.
Sim: Make missile code generic aircraft independent.
Sim: Include Shinobis missile changes into missile code. (heat)
Sim: Stop auto-selecting when in tactical mode.
Sim: RB99 will be rail launched if sitting on a rail instead of always dropped.
Sim: Add RB-04.
Sim: Be able to notch the rb71 again.
Sim: A/P control in cockpit: A/T on throttle. Trims change heading/altitude. Chapter 12-4 in AJS37 manual part 1.
Effect: Rembrandt landing lightcone.
Effect: Make pilot faint/die due to G-forces.
Effect: Make tires burst if too high speed with parking brakes.
Effect: Smoke after structural break.
Effect: Adjust normalmap to be more subtle.
Sound: More annunciater warnings and other sounds. (transonic)
Sound: Make sounds when taking damage in bombable.
Sound: Adjust the volume of the explosion of nearby missile, depending on distance.
Radar: When ILS and DME is tuned to airport, show it on radar with a 20km centerline.
Radar: Show artificial horizon lines.
HUD: Make boxes for desired pitch.
HUD: Alt scale follow pitch lines at more than 1 degree roll from level flight. (swedish pilots seems able to read upside down, not sure I will make this)
HUD: Make too low reference speed change reticle vertical tail down.
HUD: All track semi circles and semi box should have a line in them. (might degrade performance)
HUD: Fix that HUD selects diamond_node, not radar logic, so HUD can be turned off in external view.
HUD: When DME are enabled at the same time as ILS with glideslope, the distance scale make the ILS view confusing.
HUD: Sidewind indicator should really be 10 degs below plane axis line.



Bugs:
--------------
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping. [not reproduced]
Report: {JabberWocky} After A/P the plane consumes too much fuel. [not reproduceable]
Sim: {JazzTp} On Linux, after firing first missile, the key bindings for weapons go to other things, like exit FG. [Cannot reproduce on Win]
Sim: Missiles do not show when using FG 3.0, in FG 3.1+ they work fine. [reproduced]
Sim: Missiles will not lock on to ferries that is missing the radar properties.
Sim: Find out why cannon and sidewinder fire randomly after instant replay.
Sim: {JazzTp} A repair did repair aircraft except for HUD, it was frozen. [not reproduced yet]
Sim: {JazzTp} Radar screen did not see MP aircraft pass by. [not reproduced yet]
Sim: When relocating or pausing, autostart might fail. [reproduced]
Sim: When Bombable 4.5 is installed redout and blackout might not work properly. [related to certain Bombable settings I think]
Sim: The auto-pilot can be bank unstable when auto-coordination is turned on.
HUD: {JazzTp} When FG HUD is in 2nd or 3rd mode, it does not go away when switching to custom. [reproduced]
HUD: I have experienced that tactical mode was on by default. [not reliable reproduced]
HUD: When the altitude difference to a track is much larger than the horizontal distance, the track positions are off.
GUI: The performance monitor can duplicate itself when selecting airport. [reproduced]
Model: sim load-lag when coming near other ja37. [reproduced, select anims are probably to blame]
Model: Sim lag at final retraction of gear. [reproduced, select anims are to blame]
Model: CTRL-X in HUD view will not zoom to correct level.
Animation: Selection view does not follow carriers or other ships till they move. (they lack radar properties)
Model: In FG 2.12 radar screen does not work as it should. (no canvas replacement)
Sim: Sometimes when exploding, the sim freezes, typically at redout.
Sim: {JazzTP} Replay did not replay explosion.
Sound: Could hear aim-9 buzz even though not in tact mode, in external view.
HUD: In landing mode when horizont is out of view, heading scale does not show commanded heading.
HUD: In landing mode, commanded altitude lines can be confused with ILS guidance.
Aero: Above mach 1 at higher altitudes, then plane seems to do some pitch oscillations. (Does not seem to be pitch damper fault)
Sim: {Pinto} After fire M70, and reload, they will fire again. [might be fixed]
Control: {Pinto} Pitch damper does fast violent oscillations at 36000ft M2.25+ without droptank.
HUD: When autostarting is in progress, the HUD will switch off for a fraction of a second sometimes when loading stores. (due to stores mass moving the aircraft a bit and external power then gets disconnected.).
HUD: In tactical mode the diamond would sometimes not be painted. Distance, callsign and tail would be shown though.
Model: Droptank indicator should really be a steerpoint indicator.
Model: Desert livery over MP is broken now.
Model: There is a gap between fuselage and engine, where one can see 'into' the model.
Sim: {Pinto} Has experienced that 2 engine directories were created under engines. That leads to error in performance monitor.

Issues with FG:
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also.
