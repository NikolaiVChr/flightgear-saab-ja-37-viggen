Sim: Complete hydraulic dependencies: Brakes.
Sim: Hydraulic drain.
Sim: Shift-m should be a key without shift instead for convenience.

Sim: Make weapons hit all nearby targets.
Sim: Make dumb bombs not require a target.
Sim: When inverted for more than 10 secs, let oil pressure be affected, and disrupt engine operations.
Sim: Make schedule for max climb rate with A/P at slow speed different when gears is down (or A/T AoA hold).
Sim: Make flare over MP use int instead of String.
Radar: Make database of RCS of common aircrafts.
Effect: Rembrandt landing lightcone.
Effect: Make pilot faint/die due to G-forces.
Effect: Make tires burst if too high speed with parking brakes.

Sound: More annunciater warnings and other sounds. (transonic)
Sound: Make sounds when taking damage in bombable.
Sound: Adjust the volume of the explosion of nearby missile, depending on distance.
Sound: Rework how missile buzz and growl works.
Radar: When ILS and DME is tuned to airport, show it on radar with a 20km centerline?
Radar: Show artificial horizon lines.
HUD: Make boxes for desired pitch.
HUD: Alt scale follow pitch lines at more than 1 degree roll from level flight. (swedish pilots seems able to read upside down, not sure I will make this)
HUD: All track semi circles and semi box should have a line in them. (might degrade performance)
HUD: Fix that HUD selects diamond_node, not radar logic, so HUD can be turned off in external view.
HUD: When DME are enabled at the same time as ILS with glideslope, the distance scale make the ILS view confusing.
HUD: Make crossing out of hud when armament not ready to fire and trigger is pressed.
HUD: Make use of Richards new wrapper, to improve terrain warning. (2017.1.1)



Bugs:
--------------
Aero: Above mach 1 at higher altitudes, then plane seems to do some pitch oscillations. (Does not seem to be pitch damper fault)
Animation: Selection view does not follow carriers or other ships till they move. (they lack radar properties)
Control: {Pinto} Pitch damper does fast violent oscillations at 36000ft M2.25+ without droptank.
GUI: The performance monitor can duplicate itself when selecting airport. [reproduced]
HUD: In landing mode when horizont is out of view, heading scale does not show commanded heading.
HUD: In landing mode, commanded altitude lines can be confused with ILS guidance.
HUD: When autostarting is in progress, the HUD will switch off for a fraction of a second sometimes when loading stores. (due to stores mass moving the aircraft a bit and external power then gets disconnected.).
HUD: When the altitude difference to a track is much larger than the horizontal distance, the track positions are off.
HUD: {JazzTp} When FG HUD is in 2nd or 3rd mode, it does not go away when switching to custom. [reproduced]
Model: CTRL-X in HUD view will not zoom to correct level.
Model: Droptank indicator should really be a steerpoint indicator.
Model: In FG 2.12 radar screen does not work as it should. (no canvas replacement)
Model: sim load-lag when coming near other ja37. [reproduced, select anims are probably to blame]
Model: All shader use of <use> does not work over MP.
Radar: Shooting at imdrone ship, it blinks in and out before getting lock.
Report: {JabberWocky} After A/P the plane consumes too much fuel. [not reproduceable]
Sim: Check missile sound at KCA again..
Sim: Find out why cannon and sidewinder fire randomly after instant replay.
Sim: If HoT (/sim/multiplay/hot) is enabled, geo reports wrong ground elevation at a AI/MP aircraft location.
Sim: Missiles do not show when using FG 3.0, in FG 3.1+ they work fine. [reproduced]
Sim: Missiles will not lock on to ferries that is missing the radar properties.
Sim: Sometimes when exploding, the sim freezes, typically at redout. [was bug in jsbsim, fixed in 2016.1]
Sim: The auto-pilot can be bank unstable when auto-coordination is turned on.
Sim: When a missile hits the console will now report a wrong distance.
Sim: When Bombable 4.5 is installed redout and blackout might not work properly. [related to certain Bombable settings I think]
Sim: When relocating or pausing, autostart might fail. [reproduced]
Sim: {JazzTp} A repair did repair aircraft except for HUD, it was frozen. [not reproduced yet]
Sim: {JazzTp} On Linux, after firing first missile, the key bindings for weapons go to other things, like exit FG. [Cannot reproduce on Win]
Sim: {JazzTp} Radar screen did not see MP aircraft pass by. [not reproduced yet]
Sim: {JazzTP} Replay did not replay explosion.
Sim: {Pinto} After fire M70, and reload, they will fire again. [might be fixed]
Sim: {Pinto} Has experienced that 2 engine directories were created under engines. That leads to error in performance monitor.
Sound: Could hear aim-9 growl even though not in tact mode, in external view.
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping. [not reproduced]
Effect: Firing many M70 rockets in quick succession will make FG crash. [Probably fixed]


Issues with FG:
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also.
