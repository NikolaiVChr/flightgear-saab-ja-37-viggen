This is a description of some of the more advanced systems on the JA-37Di.
It targets advanced users, who are already familiar with basic systems.
Less advanced users should first refer to the flight manual Doc/JA_manual.pdf
The systems are described assuming the aircraft is in English/imperial mode.
The menu item names and units etc. is different in Swedish/metric mode, maybe in future will make manual for that also.



Flightplans
===========
The aircraft has 12 plans. 4 mission (1-4) and 8 return to base plans (A & B for each landing base). Additionally it can have 6 map-areas defined.
Notice since clicking key 'Y' is the same as LS on TI display, this will also switch plan if you are already on a mission plan.

Cursor on TI/MI
===============
There are several options for cursor controls (see also Doc/JA_manual.pdf):
- Pressing key 'y' will toggle slaving flight-controls to the cursor instead.
  Terrain impact warning will switch the slaving off, so you get immediate control of the aircraft to avoid terrain impact.
  Pressing key 'l' will click.
- Enable the option 'Arrow keys control radar cursor' in the 'Options' dialog.
  The cursor can then be controlled with directional arrows, and 'enter' can be used to click.
- Joystick bindings for the cursor can be added.
  In the 'Joystick Configuration' dialog, they are called 'Cursor Horizontal',
  'Cursor Vertical', and 'Cursor Click'.
  For joystick configuration files, the corresponding properties are
    controls/displays/cursor-slew-x
    controls/displays/cursor-slew-y
    controls/displays/cursor-click

Per default the cursor is located on the MI display. It can be moved to the TI with 'M', or through the DISP menu.
On the TI you can click on all side and bottom buttons, except when EDIT, ADD or INS steerpoint/map-area-point. Also when not in any menu.
Sometimes in menu MSDA a white info box is shown. Some fields can be clicked, and then input on the data-panel. Field will blink when input active.
When MMAN is enabled, map will be moved instead of cursor.
When clicking on a radar echo in MI, it get selected/locked.
When clicking on radar or datalink track on TI, it is selected as destination.
In MSDA/UDAT menu LV/FF points can be dragged when no polygon is being edited. To grab them hold trigger on center of symbol.
When a polygon is being edited and a steerpoint/aera-point has been selected, pressing |X| button on nav panel will delete it. (cannot delete landing bases or take-off base, use route-manager for that)

Concise overview of Datapanel (DAP) and Navpanel
================================================

DAP is located on right panel, has keypad and display, Navpanel is next to it

OK button is on nav panel.
<- (BACKSPACE) on navpanel will go one digit back when inputting.
|X| (CLEAR FIELD) on navpanel will clear current digits entered in input mode. Or in 237 mode it will clear the value altogether. If on TI a steerpoint is selected in a route being edited, this button will delete the steerpoint.
Other buttons used on the nav. panel is L and LB for yellow/green antiaircraft areas (LV).
Nav. panel is located just next to data-panel.
Notice the two lights with IN/OUT and POS/MSDA, those are buttons also.

If POS/MSDA button is in POS mode and the other button in OUT, the display will show steerpoint info. This is also the default state of the data-panel.
  nbaaau  - n: 0=steerpoint 1=airport, aaa: distance, u: uncertainty.

Below is listed what combination of IN/OUT with the knob will produce (if the other button is set to MSDA):

OUT
- TILS:   Shows current TILS frequency on display.
- CL/DA:  Show date/time on display. Cycle with OK.
- FUEL:   Show extra fuel warning setting in percent on display.
- LOLA:   Show current LON/LAT on display. Cycle with OK.

IN
- TILS:  
- CL/DA:  Set date/time. Entering 999999 for either date or time will reset.
- FUEL:   Set extra fuel warning in percent. (threshold will trigger master warning)
- LOLA:  

ACDATA:

      * x: Controls HUD altitude scale features (in interoperability mode only):
         - current altitude window, enabled with x=2,3
         - airbase altitude index, enabled with x=1,3 (requires QNH mode)
      * y: 1=interoperability mode, 0=Swedish/metric mode
      * z: 1=use QNH, 0=use QFE (QFE is always used in metric mode)
      * d is ignored
    30xbcd GPS Installed = 1, NO GPS = 0. b, c and d is ignored.

REG/STR:
- IN:  Input 2 digits for address, then either the value you want to set, or switch to OUT.
- OUT: If 2 first digits entered will show value of address in last 4 digits.
- ADDRESSES:
    18axcd if x=1, display terrain height on HUD instead of radar altitude
    19xxxx is training floor altitude (in 100m, or 100ft in interoperability mode).
    52xxxd is loadfactor in percent for aural g-force warning. d is ignored. From 075 to 110.

TI
note1: the LV, FF and bulls-eye will be shown on TI display. If DAP knob is on TI or TI menu MSDA is active, the address number will also be shown.
note2: LV stands for airdefense area, and FF for pilot point.
- IN/MSDA:  Input 3 digits for address, then either switch to out or click OK (for red), L/LB/LF/BX (for yellow)
            To unlock for deletion type the unlock code followed by CLEAR.

            654321 is code for unlocking delete option. Turning knob or switching IN/OUT will reengage lock.

"237" on display
- Input to TI press OK to send or press |X| to delete the value.

"Error" on display
- rotate knob or in/out switch to clear.

When inputting, pay notice to the switch +/-, as that is the sign of what you input. For some inputs its ignored though and hence not shown when you input.



IFF
===
See the flight manual Doc/JA_manual.pdf



Fighter Link
============
Fighter link allows several JA-37 to share their position, and the position of any aircraft tracked on radar.
The positions of these aircrafts is then displayed on the TI, just like regular radar contacts.
- Aircrafts considered friendly are displayed in green.
  An aircraft is considered as friendly if
  * it is on fighter link
  * or it has been identified as friedly (IFF) by you or another aircraft on fighter link.
- Other aircrafts are considered potentially hostile, and are displayed in red.
In order to work, all JA-37 must enable fighter link, and tune it to the same channel.

Enabling Fighter Link
---------------------
Fighter Link is turned on/off with the SYST>DL menu on the TI.
When on, the DL menu is highlighted by a box, and a small 'DL' symbol on the lower left of the TI becomes green.

Channel Selection
-----------------
Fighter link channel is selected with the KV3 channel selector
(front left side, between the KV1 comm radio channel selector and the left warning panel).
To enter a new channel, press the 'DEL' button to clear the input field,
then enter the channel with the numpad on the KV1 comm radio channel selector just behind.




Aural warning tones
===================
There is different warning tones for the following: (ordered in priority, notice pre-warnings has lowest priority)
- Master warning (can be played at same time as other tones)
- Ground collision (volume cannot be changed)
- Flare/chaff release
- Flares out
- Low speed
- High angle-of-attack (2 pre and 1 main, limits depends on altitude and gears)
- High G-force (2 pre and 1 main, limits depend on aircraft weight and gears) 
- Vne speed exceeded.
- Entering transonic regime
- Below training floor

Volume can be adjusted on left FR29 radio panel (the smaller knob).
Ground collision warning (including the displays/HUD arrows) can be switched off on the navpanel.
G-force (loadfactor) warning threshold can be changed on DAP, REG address 52.
The GVV circuit breaker can disable g-force, low-speed and AoA warnings.


Aural information tones
=======================
- Incoming missile (positional)
- Radar missile lock
- Sidewinder growl

Volume can be adjusted on left vertical panel.



Testing
=======
The following conditions must be present before testing:
--------------------------------------------------------
- Wheels on ground
- INS (Inertial navigation system) not initializing

and either:

- External power supplying
or
- DC and AC power on.
- Throttle not idle
- Throttle not too high

Test
----
On test panel, click FK to get into testing mode. Displays, HUD and air-condition will shut off.
To abort either switch engine starter or click FK.
Click START/STOPP to start testing. While test of a system is ongoing data-panel minus sign will blink, and the 2 first digits will show which system being tested.
The result of a test is shown on the data-panel without a minus sign. First 2 digits is the system, next 4 digits is details of the result.
When a test is successful the green lamp will show.
  You can then click START/STOPP to acknowledge and start test of next system.
When a test is unsuccessful the red lamp will show.
  You can then click START/STOPP to acknowledge and start test of next system.
  Or click FEL to not acknowledge and start next test.
  Or click REP to repeat the test.
During a test you can click START/STOPP to skip to next test.
When last test has been acknowledged or dis-acknowledged the testing ends.
For now only AUTO testing can be done, meaning it will test all 20 systems. Testing through TI is not enabled yet.

Max allowed EPR (engine pressure ratio) at initialization of reverser is 1.75.
Max allowed reverse at stationary aircraft is 1.4 EPR.
Max rolling speed in groundspeed: 320 Km/h (172.8 Kt).
Max touchdown pitch: 20.5 deg clearing uncompressed, 16 deg partial compressed at flare, 14 degs fully compressed.
Minimum touchdown speed 100 kt (only at 15.5 AoA short landings of course).
Nosewheel touchdown speed: latest at 160 KM/h (86 kt).



Check here for more up to date landing info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL3nb-itZqU&list=PLogi97V-ki0GfCLqimTtIq9RIVcm-GRFE&index=8

NOTICE: The following examples are outdated:

Example 1: Ad-hoc visual landing
--------------------------------
In no particular order do these:
1: If you know the barometer pressure at the airport then set into one of the altimeters.
2: Hit key 'Y'.
3: Tune into ILS. [optional]
4: Click the button 15.5 on front panel for short landing.

Align the aircraft for the approach and slow down to about 550 Km/h (297 kt) and be about 500 m (1640 ft) AGL.
At 15 Km (about 7.6 NM) distance from touchdown, extend gears. Engage reverse thrust if you want it to engage auto when you land.
At 10 Km (5.4 NM) out, start to descend. The HUD will show the 2.86 deg descent line, which of-course fits, since there is 10000m left to touchdown and you are 500m above it, so a 1:20 slope.
Notice though that that same line will start to indicate maximum sink rate (2.8 m/s) below 15m (or 35m if radar altimeter is off), so when that happens be sure to keep the flight path indicator above or on the line when that happens to not risk stress the landing gears, but still below the horizon so you don't overshoot.
You will notice when that happens if u keep your eyes peeled on the HUD, the line will do a 'jump' and no longer be fixed, and at the same time if ILS/glideslope is set, it will no longer follow that, so last part is always a non aided (except for sink rate) visual landing.
Also notice that the HUD will before descent when in landing mode assist you in hitting the 550Km/h speed, by moving the 'tail' on the flight path indicator.
That same tail will during descent help you keep your AoA (9-12 or 15.5 if that button is engaged).
Now if you did not press the 15.5 button, then do a small flare before you touchdown.
If you engaged reverser, then apply thrust after touchdown.

Example 2: Ad-hoc visual landing with A/T
-----------------------------------------
Do the same as above but with engaged auto-throttle.
When you extend gears, it will automatically keep your AoA.

Example 3: AJ37 landing with waypoint  (TODO: update and move to aj37 readme, and replace with ja37 version)
-------------------------------------
In no particular order do these:
1: get the barometer QFE from the ATC tower and set it.
2: be sure the active waypoint in the Route manager is set to the correct airport and runway.
3: select landing mode with the main mode selector knob (radar panel).
4: Tune into ILS. [optional]
5: Engage reverse thrust if you want it to engage auto when you land.
6: Adjust the approach length on the left panel with the switch APPROACH. 5.4 or 10.8 Nmiles.
7: Click the button 15.5 for short runways.

Notice there is now shown altitude lines on HUD and radar, start descending to align to them and aim for hitting tangentially the circle shown on radar Pinto talks about. When you hit the approach circle, you are supposed to be at 550Km/h or 297 Kt and 500m/1640ft above the airport, and you just follow the circle around keeping that speed. The approach circle is always 4.1 Km radius. For short approaches you will then immediately start descending when you hit the approach line, and for long approaches you will follow that line until half (5.4 NM out) and then start descending. The HUD will show the 2.86 deg descent line when you hit that 10 Km mark, which of-course fits, since there is 10000m left to touchdown and you are 500m above it, so a 1:20 slope. Notice though that that same line will start to indicate maximum sink rate (2.8 m/s) below 15m (or 35m if radar altimeter is off), so when that happens be sure to keep the flight path indicator above or on the line when that happens to not risk stress the landing gears, but still below the horizon so you don't overshoot. You will notice when that happens if u keep your eyes peeled on the HUD, the line will do a 'jump' and no longer be fixed, and at the same time if ILS/glideslope is set, it will no longer follow that, so last part is always a non aided (except for sink rate) visual landing. Also notice that the HUD will before descent when in landing mode assist you in hitting the 550Km/h speed, by moving the 'tail' on the flight path indicator. That same tail will during descent help you keep your AoA (9-12 or 15.5 if that button is engaged).
