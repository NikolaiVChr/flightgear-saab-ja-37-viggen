4.318 - 2020 July 23
=====
Major change: Complete FCS and autopilot rework by Octal450.
The new flight controls are very accurately modelled based on the flight manuals, making it far more realistic than the previous FBW-like controls.
Notable features:
- Individual simulation of each control surfaces, with pitch/roll mixing
- Gearings automatically change the surface vs stick deflection ratios depending on speed
- Autopilot STICK mode provides damping (always on under normal conditions)

- Speed hold (for cruise) and AoA (for landing) autothrottle modes
- Detailed autopilot and autothrottle engagement/disengagement/warning logic
