Sim: Backup generator is now a ram air turbine, as per the manual.
Model: Did a overhaul of the left and right indicator panels logic, they now work even more like described in the manual.
Sim: Moved all indicator logics to JSBSim. Except master warning.
Model: Pressing the test light button, will now also test the master warning including the sound.
Model: Some indicator panel lights are now better translated from swedish.
Sim: When master warning button is clicked, the master warning lights now become steady on.
Sim: If autopilot malfunction for lack of power or hydraulic, the locks now will stay checked, it will just stop working.
Sound: Fixed that if the gears got stuck between up and down position that the gear retraction sound would continue to play.
Sound: Made the gear retraction sound higher pitched.
Sim: Fixed that electrical warning would not go off if backup system was running.
Sim: The backup ram air generator now works at the airspeeds indicated by the JA-37C manual.
Control: The nosegear steering is now limited to 30 degrees to each side, as per the manual.
Control: The gears can now not retract at loss of hydraulic 1, but can still extend and lock by gravity if hydraulic 2 has enough pressure.

3.104 - 2015 December 9
=====
Model: On the ground the AoA indicator will now show pitch angle, not AoA. As per the JA-37C manual.
