#### Saab 37 Viggen radio preset example file

# This is an example file for documentation purpose.
# See Nasal/radios/channels-default.txt for the default configuration.


### Generalities
#
## Syntax
#
# Each line in this file is a pair
# CHANNEL   FREQUENCY
# Empty lines are ignored. Comments starting with '#' are allowed.
# The channel and frequency on a non-empty line must be separated by whitespace (space or tab).
# Additional whitespace (before, between, after the channel and frequency) is ignored.
#
# Allowed channel names are detailed in the rest of this file.
# Frequencies are given as a floating point number (no suffix, etc.) in MHz.
# The exact frequency must be given, e.g. 120.025 can not be abbreviated to 120.02
# There is no restriction on the formatting of frequencies, e.g. 120.000 and 0120 are equivalent.
# For style, it is recommended to stick to the format XXX.XXX
#
## Frequency restrictions
#
# Any frequency can be assigned to a channel in the configuration file,
# but that does not mean the aircraft radio will be able to use it.
# Allowed frequencies are the following.
# AJS37:
# - FR22 main radio:
#   VHF 103.000MHz - 155.975MHz, 25KHz separation
#   UHF 225.000MHz - 399.950MHz, 50KHz separation
# - FR24 backup radio:
#   VHF 110.000MHz - 147.000MHz, 50KHz separation
# JA37D:
# - FR29 main radio:
#   VHF 103.000MHz - 159.975MHz, 25KHz separation
#   UHF 225.000MHz - 399.975MHz, 25KHz separation
# - FR31 secondary radio:
#   VHF 104.000MHz - 161.975MHz, 25KHz separation
#   UHF 223.000MHz - 407.975MHz, 25KHz separation
#
# Note that the VHF bands contain the usual NAV band.
# Don't be surprised to hear a VOR identifier if you tune to its frequency.
#
## Channels
#
# Not all radios can use all channels. Restrictions are detailled in the rest of this file.
#
# There are three types of channels: airbase channels (prefixed by B in this file),
# group channels (prefixed by N in this file), and other 'special' channels.
#
## Loading configuration files
#
# Channels configuration files can be loaded in FlightGear using the 'load radio channels' dialog.
# When loading a channels configuration file, any previously existing channel is erased.
#
# However it is possible to load two separate configuration files:
# one for group channels, and one for airbase channels.
# When loading e.g. a file for group/special channels, all currently loaded
# airbase channels are preserved, and all airbase channels in this file are ignored.
#
# When using two configuration files, airbase global channels E,F,G are loaded
# from the airbase channels file, while special channels S1,S2,S3,M,L are loaded
# from the group channels file.
#
# The following properties can be set to load configuration files at startup:
# - ja37/radio/channels-file
# - ja37/radio/group-channels-file
# - ja37/radio/base-channels-file
# (the latter two have priority over the former).


### Special channels

# Global airbase channels
E       127.000
F       118.500
G       125.500
# H is guard channel 121.5

# JA preset channels (last two positions of the FR29 knob, unavailable on AJS)
M       132.850
L       122.950

# AJS special channels 1-3 (FR22 3 unlabelled buttons on the top row)
S1      135.425
S2      285.150
S3      240.550


### Group channels.
#
# Channel name of the form NXXC
# - literal 'N' prefix
# - XX is the group number (two digits)
# - C is the channel number within the group (0 to 9)
# AJS can use group numbers 01 to 41
# JA can use group numbers 00 to 42 with FR29 main radio, and 00 to 11 with FR31 secondary radio.
#
# Optional group descriptions of the form NXX <description> are allowed.

# In the default config, JA channels 001-003 correspond to AJS special channels 1-3

### Airbase channels.
#
# Channel name of the form BXXXC[C]
# - literal 'B' prefix
# - XXX is the base number (three digits)
# - C[C] is the channel name, one of A,B,C,C2,D
# AJS can use airbase numbers 01 to 69
# JA can use airbase numbers 00 to 99 with FR29 main radio, 00 to 169 with FR31 secondary radio.
#
# The AJS FR22 or JA FR29 radios can not use airbase numbers over 100, thus the airbase
# number is selected without leading 0 on the corresponding channel selectors.
#
# Optional group descriptions of the form BXXX <description> are allowed.
